~org-randomnote~ intends to provide a way to bring randomness into your Org-Mode workflow. It does so by implementing the "Random Note" functionality popularized by Tiago Forte with Evernote in Emacs Org-Mode.

Here is an example configuration, using John Wiegley's ~use-package~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-randomnote
    :ensure t
    :bind ("C-c r" . org-randomnote))
#+END_SRC

Once loaded, run the interactive command ~org-randomnote~.

You can configure which files ~org-randomnote~ selects from with the variable ~org-randomnote-candidates~. It defaults to using ~org-agenda-files~, but you can use any list of files:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-randomnote-candidates '("~/org/todo.org"))
#+END_SRC

You can also configure the behavior with which ~org-randomnote~ opens files. By default, it simply moves to a random note's header. However, you can also configure it to use an indirect buffer, like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-randomnote-open-behavior 'indirect-buffer)
#+END_SRC
